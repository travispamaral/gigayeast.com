description: From one of the first breweries in North America to create a successful
  line of traditional Abbey style ales.  This Belgian ale yeast creates a malt forward
  beer with subtle fruity esters and a very small amount of clove notes.   Robust
  attenuation makes this yeast an excellent choice for low or high gravity beers where
  a slightly sweet malty finish is desired.  Perfect for the Belgian Dubbel and Tripel
  styles.
