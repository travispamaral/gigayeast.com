name: German Sticke Yeast
yeast_id: GY094
brief_description: From one of the oldest continuous producers of the Altbier and
  Sticke Altbier styles. Sticke bier has a touch more malt and hops than Altbier--
  the name Sticke refers to a whisper or rumor that the brewer was generous with this
  batch of beer. GY094 German Sticke yeast produces a smooth, malty beer with touches
  of honey and fruity esters.  Perfect for any balanced or malt forward beer—especially
  Altbier, Sticke, Doppelsticke or German ale. Fermentation below 60F is possible
  but may require higher pitch rates and longer fermentation times. GY094 may produce
  a moderate amount of sulfur during fermentation that will dissipate leaving a clean
  beer.

attenuation_high_gravity: 64% - 68% (9.2% - 9.9% ABV)
