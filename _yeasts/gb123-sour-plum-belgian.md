description: |-
  Blend of Trappist ale yeast and lactic acid bacteria.  No wild yeast or Brett.  Creates a clean tart beer with stone fruit esters and no discernible phenolics.  In general, sour blends require a longer fermentation time than pure ale strains–  7-10 days at a minimum– to finish.

  Lactic Acid Bacteria are inhibited by hops, high gravity and low temperatures. You can adjust sourness by increasing or decreasing these variables. More than 7 IBU, gravity above 1050 or temps below 65 F will increase the time to sour or lead to reduced overall souring. Warmer fermentation temps will typically increase the esters and spicy phenolics of the belgian ale yeast in this blend.
