14 days at 71 F in 1045 sweet wort, pH 5.6

Apparent Attenuation - 78%

ABV - 4.5%

Final pH - 3.6 (100X acidification)

1\.5% lactic acid W/V

General Notes: Lactic Acid Bacteria are inhibited by hops, high gravity, and low temperatures. You can adjust sourness by increasing or decreasing these variables. More than 7 IBUs, gravity about 1050, or temps below 65 F, will increase the time to sour ro lead to reduced overall souring. Warmer fermentation temps will typically increase the esters and spicy phenolics of the saison ale yeast in this blend.
