  esters.
description: |-
  Blend of 3 Brett strains and Lactic Acid Bacteria
  This blend creates an amazing complex, sour beer with fruity cherry esters.  Fermenting in the presence of 7-10 IBUs will cause the fermentation to complete much more quickly but will slow the souring —  expect to wait 3-4 months for significant souring.  Fermenting with zero or less than 5 IBUs will allow souring to happen much faster (within two weeks) but will cause the fermentation to take up to 4 weeks to complete.
recommended_temperature_range: 68 F to 80 F
tasting_notes: Creates a tart beer with cherry esters and complex flavors.
