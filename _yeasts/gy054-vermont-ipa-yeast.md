description: 'From one of the best examples of an east coast IPA.  This yeast attenuates
  slightly less than NorCal Ale #1 and leaves a beer with more body and a slight fruity
  ester that is amazing with aromatic hops.  Good choice for high gravity beers and
  hoppy styles.  Broad temperature range and moderate flocculation make this yeast
  a versatile house strain.'
