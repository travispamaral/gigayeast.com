tasting_notes: A blend of Brettanomyces yeast that produces stone fruit esters and
  a hint of barnyard. Creates a moderate amount of acid that adds a tart complexity
  to the brew.  This blend is highly attenuative if left for long periods of time
  but ferments more slowly than a typical ale yeast.  Use GB156 in a primary if fermented
  for 2-3 weeks or for conditioning a fermented beer during aging.
