description: Lager yeast used to create the California Common beer style.  Ferments
  unusually high for a lager strain and still retains a lager sensibility (up to 68˚F).  This
  yeast leaves a slightly sweeter beer than our other lager yeast— perfect for creating
  a subtle, malty undertone against a clean lager background.  Creates a moderate
  amount of sulfide under some conditions that will dissipate with a short rest.  Fermentations
  at traditional lager temperatures may be slow.  Recommended 55˚- 68˚F.
representative_styles: California Common, Cream Ale, Stout
