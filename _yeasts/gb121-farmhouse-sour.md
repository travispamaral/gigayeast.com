description: |-
  Blend of Belgian Ale Yeast, Brettanomyces and Lactic Acid Bacteria
  Lactic Acid Bacteria are inhibited by hops, high gravity and low temperatures. You can adjust sourness by increasing or decreasing these variables. More than 7 IBU, gravity above 1050 or temps below 65 F will increase the time to sour or lead to reduced overall souring. Warmer fermentation temps will typically increase the esters and spicy phenolics of the saison ale yeast in this blend.
recommended_temperature_range: 68 F to 80 F
tasting_notes: Bright sour flavors with sweet, fruity esters, small amount of spicy
  phenolics and a hint of funky barnyard.
