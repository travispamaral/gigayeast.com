description: Traditional yeast from the originator of the Belgian Golden Strong Ale
  style.   Robust attenuation makes this yeast an excellent choice for low or high
  gravity belgian and farmhouse style ales.  Leaves a dry, slightly tart finish with
  an estery profile reminiscent of apple and pear with a subdued level of spicy phenolics.  This
  yeast produces a moderate amount of sulfide  that will dissipate quickly with conditioning.
