  Brettanomyces Bruxellensis
  This yeast is highly attenuative but tends to ferment about ½ as fast as a typical ale strain.  Although it attenuates faster than GB001, it is typically best used in combination with faster fermenting yeast in the primary or added to the secondary to add complexity while aging.
recommended_temperature_range: 68 F to 80 F
