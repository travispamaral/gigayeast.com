description: From one of the most famous stouts in the world.  Creates a crisp, dry
  beer with a subtle fruity profile and a slightly tangy finish.  Makes an amazing
  stout or porter but is also great for red, amber and even pale ales.  This ale yeast
  is a robust fermenter perfect for high gravity brews and settles out well enough
  to create a relatively clear beer.
