info: 'I was born and raised in the heart of Silicon Valley. After graduating high
  school, I decided that a working-class hero was something to be and this mindset
  led me to bounce around at odd jobs in Southern California while learning to surf.
  A desire to learn more about and experience my ethnic identity lead me to complete
  a National Outdoor Leadership School semester abroad in India. This experience humbled
  me and uncovered a desire to return to school. I graduated from UCLA with a B.S.
  in Anthropology and was drawn to the disciplines consideration of culture’s impact
  on our species’ biology and vice versa. After graduating from UCLA, I worked for
  a C.R.O. where I discovered my penchant and comfort for benchwork. This experience
  ultimately led me to my position here at GigaYeast where I hope to expand my skillset
  under the guidance of the fabulous staff here. '
