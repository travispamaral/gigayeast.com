job_title: Propagation Engineer
info: 'As an avid homebrewer, and Northeast native one could say I was raised with
  a craft beer in hand. I joined GigaYeast in 2016 as the Propagation Engineer. I
  hold a Degree in Brewing Sciences from Germany along with a BS in Biology from Stanford
  University focusing in fermentation. Growing up in the Northeast and having lived
  in the UK and Europe for several years, I instantly fell in love with true craft
  beer. Seeing the amazing diversity and regionality of fermented beverages, inspired
  me to pick up a mash paddle and begin brewing at home over a decade ago. Outside
  of the office, I enjoy cooking, particularly molecular gastronomy having studied
  it at Le Cordon Bleu, and cheering for my home teams: the Patriots and Yankees!'
