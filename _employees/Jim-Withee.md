info: 'The most mysterious and beautiful part of brewing is fermentation.  Think about
  it:  a live microorganism transforms the sugars and protein from malt into a complex
  flavorful fizzy beverage.  You’d think by now someone would have figured out how
  to make synthetic beer.  But they haven’t.  We still depend on live brewers yeast
  for that transformation today just like humans have for thousands of years.  It’s
  one of the most complex and beautiful transformations in nature and the alchemy
  of fermentation has fascinated the best scientific minds for hundreds of years.
  I founded GigaYeast, Inc. to be a part of the craft beer and home brew movement
  using the skills and love for yeast and fermentation I cultivated over 20 + years
  of science and beer.  As a young graduate student I received a PhD for studies on
  yeast genetics.  After graduate school I worked at the Saccharomyces Genome Database–  that’s
  where the then newly sequenced DNA of brewers yeast was first completed.  All the
  while I was watching the craft beer movement grow and gaining a deeper and deeper
  appreciation for truly fine brew.  After years of work as a Government Scientist
  I finally quit my high paying job and built the GigaYeast Laboratory.  I put everything
  I know (and own!) into this laboratory and the end result is a process that creates
  perfect yeast.  Now get out there and brew–  we’re getting thirsty making all this
  beautiful yeast.'
