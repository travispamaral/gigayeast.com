name: Amelia McCullough
job_title: Office Manager
info: I joined GigaYeast as the Office Manager in August 2016. Outside of the office,
  I enjoy homebrewing and cheering for the Wisconsin Badgers. New to the Bay Area,
  I have been exploring the craft beer scene along with my trusty sidekicks Ben and
  Flint. In my former life, I was Co-Director for an archaeological laboratory in
  Belize, researching Maya sites. I highly recommend Belize as a great vacation destination
  for both beach lovers and trail blazers.
