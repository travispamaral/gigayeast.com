info: I worked in food service and restaurant management for most of my life before
  coming to GigaYeast.  Food and beer together are a natural pair and I enjoy learning
  about and consuming both. I have a degree in history from California State University
  Sacramento. Drinking beer taught me to appreciate the taste of great beer from different
  places around the world and from different eras.  History taught me how beer has
  influenced, and been influenced by, human cultures across the world and through
  the ages.  I’ve never lost a match of Edward Forty Hands.  If you don’t know what
  that is you’ll have to stop by GigaYeast and ask me.
