info: As a native South Dakotan, I grew up around cows and corn. My family introduced
  me to craft beer early in life, and I was hooked. While attending South Dakota State
  University I started working at the local brewing company. There my love for craft
  beer really blossomed. I started South Dakota’s first Girls Pint Out chapter, a
  women’s craft beer organization. After I graduated in May of 2015 with a degree
  in Biological Science, I married my wonderful husband Dustin and moved to the Bay
  Area. Now that I work at GigaYeast; I get to combine my two favorite things, beer
  and science. In my spare time I also run the San Jose Girls Pint Out chapter.
