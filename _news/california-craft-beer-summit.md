## We're headed to the California Craft Beer Summit!

On September 7th and 8th at the Sacramento Convention Center, our yeast scientists will host an interactive exhibit with hands-on demonstrations of microscopy and yeast sensory analysis, including sour perception and off-flavors. We'll also have a simple guide to starting microbial QC in the brewery and an exhibit on beer turbidity focused on creating the perfect milkshake NEIPA.

Come visit, ask us questions, and learn all about the wonders of yeast science.
