Our first order with you arrived yesterday afternoon. Within minutes of it’s arrival it had a new home in a fresh batch of wort. We’re currently redesigning our entire beer portfolio, and have decided to give GigaYeast a try.

The yeast pitch was perfect for the batch size and we are seeing high krausen less than 10 hours after pitch. The yeast was creamy, lovely, and apparently ready to work! With all the other complications of running a brewery, it’s nice to have something work literally right out of the box.

Thanks for the great start! We look forward to great beer and a great relationship.
