We just heard from Beer Post (Korea’s top beer magazine) that Kukmin IPA, beer we brewed with your GY054, was voted Korea’s #1 beer in a consumer survey. We were also voted #1 brewery in Korea! This is all the more amazing because we only started brewing this beer in August. Our Kukmin and 054 must have left quite an impression to beer enthusiasts here.

I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for working with us. It could’ve been a very complicated process shipping yeast across borders, but your guys have been utmost helpful. Could not have done this with you guys. Thank you!

Very much looking forward to working with you in the new year. Happy Holidays!
