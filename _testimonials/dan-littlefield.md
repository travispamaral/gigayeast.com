The Kolsch yeast worked beautifully and is down to about 1.009. The samples we are taking off of it are a wonderful flavor and I’m really impressed with it. We basically used our blonde recipe and tried the Kolsch yeast with it and I think it’s going to be a big improvement. I will let you know when it’s ready to go on tap and maybe you can come down and try it. We are going to use the Vermont IPA yeast tomorrow in a very hoppy pale ale that we do. I figured this would be best because the original gravity is only about 1.054.

Thanks again and I look forward to ordering more yeast soon!

Just a little quick feedback. The kolsch is a huge hit! We even have Gourmet Haus Straud (who swore to never carry a non German Kolsch) considering it. It is a wonderful yeast.

The Vermont IPA yeast has made our pale ale about as close to perfect as we have ever envisioned. This is our most popular beer and we, and more importantly customers, are amazed that it is even better now. It is drier then our previous version but just like you said has amazing aroma and maintains a maltiness that creates a unique balance that is terrific. We are Gigayeast fans for sure.

Look forward to working with you much much more!
